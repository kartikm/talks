  Non-Unicode fonts and contents floating everywhere
  You can't use same content without re-writing, re-doing it..
  You've to download fonts to 'see' particular website
  Examples

  Ancient things

  Technology
  Browsers
  Awareness
  Ignorance

  Now

  Yay! Unicode is here! Major companies, platform support
  Almost all modern browsers support without (almost) any issues
  People are using Unicode already, some are not aware though!
  You can't ignore large user base now

  Examples

  GujaratiLexicon: Entire DB in Gujarati Unicode
  Google Search
  Google Dictionary (Language1-->Language2)
  Blogs, Content, News sites
  Transliteration, Browser plug-ins
  Spell-checkers!
